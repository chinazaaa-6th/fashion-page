        Opulent designs and colours are emblematic characteristics of African
        fashion - known for being anything but boring. Historically, prints have
        always been the focus. These are rooted in tradition, harnessing
        original, native techniques in their curation, using local artisans.
        African fashion represents many different cultures and traditions, each
        with its own unique style. The diversity of African fashion is symbolic
        of Africa's diversity in culture, language, and ethnicity. More than
        that, African fashion shows emotion, style and even status. In West
        Africa, Nigeria takes the cup with their explicit fashion style and
        trend. Indeed, fashion lives in Africa.
